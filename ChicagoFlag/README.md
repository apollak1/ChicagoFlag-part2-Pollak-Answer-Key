# Chicago Flag : App Dev with SwiftUI I : Lab 2
 
 In this lab I would like you to create an image of the Chicago Flag.
  
 I have provided an image of the 6 pointed star in your Assets.xcassets directory.
 It is named "chicagoStar".  That is how you will reference the Image in your flag design.
 
 To add an image use the SwiftUI view Image() providing the name as a parameter.
 
 A couple things to note about images in SwiftUI.  
    They are initially just shown at their original size so you will need to add some modifiers to get the star to the size you want. 
    You can google resizable and scaledToFit. 
    You already then know how to change size using the frame modifier.
 
 Once you have your flag displayed properly I want you to make it so that if you tap on the either of the two middle stars,
 it will toggle all stars color from red to a color of your choice.
 
 If you tap the left most star, you should set all the stars to red.
 
 If you tap the right most star, you should set all the stars to the other color you choose.
 
 Note the left and right stars set the stars to a fixed color, it is not toggling between two different colors like the two in the center.
 
 Have fun!
